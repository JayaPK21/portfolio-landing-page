        <p>&emsp; &emsp; I am Jayashree, venturing into the world of web development. All the websites and their designs on the net have always fascinated me. 
          I am very curious to know how they work and want to learn how to build different web applications from scratch.  
        </p>
        <p>&emsp; &emsp; I have initially worked in IT for a few years but have had a long career break after that. 
          There is a couple of web designs that I have created using my current and basic knowledge of HTML and CSS which can be found in the 'Work' section.
        You are welcome to visit them and leave any feedbacks using my contact details which can be found at the end of this page.</p>
